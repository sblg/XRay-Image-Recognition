# XRay-Image-Recognition
X-ray image classification using deep learning.

## Description

This repository contains an image recognition project that uses deep learning techniques to classify X-ray images. The goal of this project is to develop a model capable of distinguishing between different conditions based on X-ray images. The dataset used for training and testing consists of X-ray images with corresponding labels.

## Model Architecture

We used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for this image recognition task. The model consists of several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers. The detailed model architecture can be found in the `src/model_architecture.py` script.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sblg/XRay-Image-Recognition.git
